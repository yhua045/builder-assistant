Summary (concise)
- Architecture: On-device ML Kit OCR + TensorFlow Lite validation for receipt → draft expense flow (#9).
- Domain model: normalized `contacts` (with `RoleType`), `properties`, `projects`, and `work_variations` added.
- Database: See [DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md](docs/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md) for migration details.
- **NEW:** Centralized workflow validator for project status transitions (#26) - implemented with TDD approach.

Completed
- Created `design/#9-Plan.md` and updated it to reflect ML Kit + TF Lite decisions.
- Opened and updated GitHub issue #10 (domain model: `projects`, `properties`, `contacts`, `work_variations`).
- Implemented TypeScript domain entities and repository interfaces under `src/domain/{entities,repositories}` for core models.
- UI: refactored dashboard and pages to use NativeWind/Tailwind; extracted reusable components for `QuickStats`, `ProjectsList`, `TasksList`, `TotalExpenseCard`, and `NextPaymentAlert`.
- **NEW (#26):** Implemented `ProjectWorkflowService` with centralized status transition validation
  - Created interface and implementation with explicit transition map
  - Integrated into `ProjectValidationService` for domain-level validation
  - Implemented `UpdateProjectStatusUseCase` demonstrating workflow validation in use cases
  - Added comprehensive test coverage (53 tests) following TDD approach
  - Documented workflow rules in `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`

## Native dependency notes

- The SQLite implementation uses a native module (`react-native-sqlite-storage`): after adding/updating native deps run:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
# or for Android
npx react-native run-android
```


## Tests location and execution

- Unit tests: stored under `__tests__/unit`. These are fast, deterministic, and use lightweight in-memory shims where appropriate (for example in-memory repository implementations) so they can run without native DB dependencies.
- Integration tests: stored under `__tests__/integration`. Integration suites exercise the Drizzle adapter and run against an in-memory SQLite instance (the test harness uses a `better-sqlite3` :memory: adapter and the `react-native-sqlite-storage` mock) and include migrations before running.

Run unit tests:
```bash
npx jest __tests__/unit --runInBand
```

Run integration tests (single-threaded):
```bash
npx jest __tests__/integration --runInBand
```
